Description: Kernel time variables configuration utility
 This package provides a utility to manipulate kernel time variables.
 For a machine connected to the Internet, or equipped with a precision
 oscillator or radio clock, the best way to keep the system clock
 accurate is using NTP (Network Time Protocol).  However, for a
 standalone or intermittently connected machine, you may use adjtimex
 instead to at least correct for systematic drift.  It can optionally
 adjust the system clock using the CMOS clock as a reference, and can
 log times for long-term estimation of drift rates.
 .
 This version of adjtimex comes from the sntpd package.

Description: Simple NTP daemon and client
 sntpd is an NTP (RFC-1305) daemon and client for UNIX systems.  Its
 functionality is a small subset of xntpd, but performs better (or at
 least has the potential to be better) within its limited scope.
 .
 Since sntpd it is much smaller than ntpd, it is also more relevant
 for embedded systems.
